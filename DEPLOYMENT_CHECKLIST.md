## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Domain Not Resolving
**Symptoms:** booksflowai.com returns "site not found" or timeout
**Solutions:**
1. Check DNS records in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify domain is properly added to site
3. Check nameserver configuration
4. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### Issue: API Routes Return 404
**Symptoms:** `/api/*` endpoints return 404 errors
**Solutions:**
1. Verify `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` is installed
2. Check build logs for function deployment
3. Ensure Next.js config doesn't have `output: 'export'`
4. Redeploy with correct configuration

### Issue: Build Failures
**Symptoms:** Deployment fails during build process
**Solutions:**
1. Check Node.js version (should be 22.x)
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Run `npm run build` locally to test
4. Check for TypeScript errors

### Issue: SSL Certificate Problems
**Symptoms:** HTTPS not working or certificate warnings
**Solutions:**
1. Force SSL certificate renewal in Netlify
2. Check domain verification status
3. Wait for certificate provisioning
4. Verify domain ownership

## üìã Environment Variables

### Required for Full Functionality
```bash
# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ...

# QuickBooks Integration
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=...
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# Payment Processing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...

# OCR Processing
MINDEE_API_KEY=...

# Email Services (Optional)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
```

### Set in Netlify Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- [ ] Add all required environment variables
- [ ] Redeploy after adding variables

## üéØ Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ **Deployment Successful When:**
1. **Domain Resolution:** booksflowai.com resolves to Netlify servers
2. **HTTPS Access:** Site loads securely with valid SSL certificate
3. **Homepage:** BooksFlowAI landing page displays correctly
4. **API Routes:** All `/api/*` endpoints respond (even if requiring auth)
5. **Performance:** Page loads quickly with no errors
6. **Build Process:** Netlify builds complete without errors

### üöÄ **Ready for Production When:**
1. All success criteria above are met
2. Environment variables are configured
3. DNS has fully propagated globally
4. All API integrations are tested
5. Error monitoring is set up

## üìû Next Steps After Deployment

### 1. **Monitor & Verify**
- [ ] Run verification script every hour for first day
- [ ] Monitor Netlify function logs
- [ ] Check error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Verify all integrations work correctly

### 2. **User Acceptance Testing**
- [ ] Test complete user workflows
- [ ] Verify QuickBooks OAuth flow
- [ ] Test receipt upload and processing
- [ ] Validate AI categorization features

### 3. **Production Readiness**
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Configure analytics (Google Analytics)
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Document any remaining issues

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** The configuration fixes are essential for BooksFlowAI to function. The platform requires serverless API routes for AI processing, QuickBooks integration, and receipt handling. Static export is not compatible with these requirements.
