# üö® IMMEDIATE NETLIFY ACTIONS REQUIRED

**Token:** `nfp_TqZCh5N6X1PvH5BBBAHbJUonTa1u3Czk8186`  
**Domain:** booksflowai.com  
**Status:** Configuration Fixed - Awaiting Deployment  

## üéØ **CRITICAL ACTIONS - DO THESE NOW:**

### 1. **Access Netlify Dashboard** (IMMEDIATE)
```
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Use token: nfp_TqZCh5N6X1PvH5BBBAHbJUonTa1u3Czk8186
3. Locate: BooksFlowAI site
```

### 2. **Check Current Status** (2 minutes)
- [ ] **Site Status:** Is it deployed? Any errors?
- [ ] **Build Logs:** Check latest build for failures
- [ ] **Domain Settings:** Is booksflowai.com connected?
- [ ] **DNS Records:** Are they pointing to Netlify?

### 3. **Force New Deployment** (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Trigger Deploy:** Force redeploy with latest commit (874a242)
- [ ] **Monitor Build:** Watch build process complete
- [ ] **Check Functions:** Verify API routes deploy as functions
- [ ] **Verify Success:** Build should complete without errors

### 4. **Domain Configuration** (10 minutes)
- [ ] **Add Domain:** Ensure booksflowai.com is added as custom domain
- [ ] **DNS Setup:** Configure these records:
  ```
  Type: A
  Name: @
  Value: [Netlify IP - shown in dashboard]
  
  Type: CNAME  
  Name: www
  Value: [your-site].netlify.app
  ```
- [ ] **SSL Certificate:** Should auto-provision after DNS setup
- [ ] **Domain Verification:** Complete if prompted

## üîç **WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**

### ‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
- Build completes with "Deploy successful" 
- Functions section shows API routes deployed
- Domain shows "DNS configured correctly"
- SSL certificate shows "Certificate provisioned"

### ‚ùå **Failure Indicators:**
- Build fails with static export errors
- No functions deployed (API routes missing)
- Domain shows DNS errors
- SSL certificate fails to provision

## üöÄ **EXPECTED RESULTS:**

After completing these actions:
1. **booksflowai.com** should load the BooksFlowAI homepage
2. **API endpoints** should be accessible (test with `/api/health`)
3. **SSL certificate** should be valid and secure
4. **Build process** should complete in 3-5 minutes

## üìû **VERIFICATION:**

Once deployed, run this command to verify everything works:
```bash
node scripts/verify-deployment.js
```

This will test:
- DNS resolution
- HTTPS connectivity  
- Homepage content
- API endpoint availability
- Netlify configuration

## üÜò **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:**

### Build Fails:
1. Check if `output: 'export'` was removed from next.config.js
2. Verify `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` is in netlify.toml
3. Check Node.js version is 22.x

### Domain Won't Connect:
1. Verify DNS records are correct
2. Check domain ownership verification
3. Wait up to 48 hours for DNS propagation

### API Routes Don't Work:
1. Ensure functions deployed in Netlify dashboard
2. Check build logs for function deployment
3. Verify Next.js config allows serverless functions
